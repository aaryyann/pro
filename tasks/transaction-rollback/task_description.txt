task: transaction-rollback
instructions: |
  You need to fix  the rollback operation to allow rolling back PENDING transactions that is present in the TransactionManager.rollback() method that is present in `src/transaction/TransactionManager.ts`.
  Currently, rollback only works  on COMMITTED  transactions , but it should also work on PENDING transactions that haven't been committed yet.
  
  The Behaviours that are expected
  Rollback  should work on both PENDING  and COMMITTED transactions 
  PENDING transactions  should be marked as ROLLED_BACK when rolled back .  
  COMMITTED transactions should also be rollbackable and marked as ROLLED_BACK    
  FAILED transactions should  not be rollbackable (returns false)  
  Non-existent transactions should return false when  rolled back
  PENDING   transactions with multiple operations should  be rollbackable (operations are preserved)
  Rolling back  an already rolled back transaction should  return false  (idempotency)
  Empty PENDING transactions (with no operations) should be rollbackable
