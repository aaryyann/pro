task_description: |
  Fix the rollback operation to allow rolling back PENDING transactions.
  Currently, rollback only works on COMMITTED transactions, but it should
  also work on PENDING transactions that haven't been committed yet.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Rollback should work on both PENDING and COMMITTED transactions
  - PENDING transactions should be marked as ROLLED_BACK
  - COMMITTED transactions should also be rollbackable
  - FAILED transactions should not be rollbackable
