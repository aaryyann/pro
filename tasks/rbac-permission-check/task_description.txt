task: rbac-permission-check
instructions: |
  Fix the permission check logic in TransactionManager.hasPermission() method that is present in `src/transaction/TransactionManager.ts`.
  The current implementation returns true for unknown roles, which is a
  security vulnerability. Unknown roles should be denied access.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Unknown roles should return false for all permission checks
  - Only roles with explicit permissions should be allowed
  - Default deny policy for security
  - Empty or null roles should be denied
  - Known roles (admin, user, guest) should have their correct permissions
  - Admin role should have all permissions (read, write, delete, execute)
  - User role should have only read and write permissions
  - Guest role should have only read permission
  - Roles with special characters should be denied if not explicitly defined
