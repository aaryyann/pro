task: rbac-permission-check
instructions: |
  You need to fix  the permission check logic that is present  the  in TransactionManager.hasPermission() method that is present in `src/transaction/TransactionManager.ts`.
  The current implementation returns true for unknown roles, which is a
  security  vulnerability. Unknown  roles should be denied access.



  
  The Behaviour that are expected to be
  Unknown roles should return false for all permission checks
  Only roles with explicit permissions should be allowed
  Default deny policy for security
  Empty or null roles should be denied
  Known roles (admin, user, guest) should have their correct permissions
  Admin role should have all permissions (read, write, delete, execute)
  User role should have only read and write permissions
  Guest role should have only read permission
  Roles with special characters should be denied if not explicitly defined
