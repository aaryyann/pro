task_description: |
  Fix the permission check logic in TransactionManager.hasPermission().
  The current implementation returns true for unknown roles, which is a
  security vulnerability. Unknown roles should be denied access.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Unknown roles should return false for all permission checks
  - Only roles with explicit permissions should be allowed
  - Default deny policy for security
  - Empty or null roles should be denied
