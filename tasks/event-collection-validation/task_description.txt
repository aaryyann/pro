task: event-collection-validation
instructions: |
  You have to fix the event collection validation that is present  in the EventCollector.collect() method in `src/analytics/EventCollector.ts`. The current implementation  silently rejects the events without id or type,
  but should handle this more gracefully or validate properly.
  


  The Behaviour that are to be expected
  Events should be validated before collection
  Invalid events should either be rejected with proper error handling
  Or validation should be more lenient if appropriate
  Events with missing required fields should be handled consistently
  
  Note that you should only modify the collect() method. The other methods like getEvents(), getEventCount(), and clear() should continue to work correctly as they are. The validation fix should not break the existing functionality of filtering events by type or userId, counting events, or clearing the collection.
