task_description: |
  Fix the event collection validation in EventCollector.collect().
  The current implementation silently rejects events without id or type,
  but should handle this more gracefully or validate properly.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Events should be validated before collection
  - Invalid events should either be rejected with proper error handling
  - Or validation should be more lenient if appropriate
  - Events with missing required fields should be handled consistently
