task: priority-queue-dequeue
instructions: |
  You need to fix  the operation of dequeue that is present  in tha  Priority Queue class that is present in `src/scheduler/PriorityQueue.ts`. The current implementation
  uses pop() instead of shift(), which removes the highest priority item from
  the wrong end of the array.




  
  Expected behavior:
  - dequeue() should remove and return the item with the highest priority
  - The highest priority item is at the beginning of the sorted array
  - Use shift() to remove from the front, not pop() from the end
  - Maintain correct priority ordering after dequeue operations
  - The queue should maintain correct size after dequeue operations
  - peek() and dequeue() should return the same item when called in sequence
