task: priority-queue-dequeue
instructions: |
  You need to fix the dequeue operation in PriorityQueue class that is present in `src/scheduler/PriorityQueue.ts`. The current implementation
  uses pop() instead of shift(), which removes the highest priority item from
  the wrong end of the array.


  
  The Behaviour to be expected is 
  dequeue() should remove  and return the  item with the highest priority
  The highest  priority item is at  the beginning of the sorted array
  Use shift() to remove from the front, not pop() from the end
  Maintain  correct priority ordering after  dequeue  operations
  The queue  should maintain correct size  after dequeue operations
  peek() and dequeue()  should return the same item when called  in sequence
  When dequeue()  is called on an empty queue , it should return  null
  Multiple  calls to dequeue() on an empty queue  should all return null
  Items with the same priority  should be handled correctly (all items  should be dequeuable)
  Negative priorities should work correctly   (higher numeric values have higher priority)
