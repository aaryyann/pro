task_description: |
  Fix the dequeue operation in PriorityQueue class. The current implementation
  uses pop() instead of shift(), which removes the highest priority item from
  the wrong end of the array.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - dequeue() should remove and return the item with the highest priority
  - The highest priority item is at the beginning of the sorted array
  - Use shift() to remove from the front, not pop() from the end
  - Maintain correct priority ordering after dequeue operations
