task_description: |
  Fix the permission check logic to ensure proper security.
  The current implementation in TransactionManager.hasPermission() returns
  true for unknown roles, which is a security vulnerability.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Unknown roles should be denied (return false)
  - Only roles with explicit permissions should be allowed
  - Implement default deny security policy
  - Edge cases with empty strings and null should be handled
