task: permission-security-check
instructions: |
  You need to fix  the   permission check logic  to ensure proper security in the PermissionSecurityCheckManager.hasPermission() method that is present in `src/transaction/PermissionSecurityCheckManager.ts`.
  The current implementation returns true  for unknown  roles, which is a security vulnerability.
  
  The Behaviour to be expected are 
  The roles that are unknown  should be denied that means return false
  The only roles that are  with explicit permissions should be allowed
  Implement default deny security policy
  The Edge cases with empty strings and null should always be handled
  The  Case sensitive role matching   should be enforced (example as 'admin' is valid but 'Admin' or 'ADMIN' should be denied)
