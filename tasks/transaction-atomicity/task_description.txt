task: transaction-atomicity
instructions: |
  You  need to fix   the transaction   commit operation to ensure proper atomicity that is present in the TransactionAtomicityManager.commit() method that is present in `src/transaction/TransactionAtomicityManager.ts`.
  The current implementation does not  handle  the  partial failures correctly ,
  and the   transactions may be left in an inconsistent state.
  
  The Behaviour to be expected
  All  operations in a transaction should always be  executed atomically
  If any of the  operation fails , the entire transaction should be rolled back
  Transaction   status should accurately  reflect the commit result
  Operations should  execute in the order   they were added
  Transactions with no operations should be  able to commit successfully
  Transactions with multiple  operations should commit atomically
  Committing  an already committed transaction should return false (idempotency)
  Committing   a non existent transaction should return false
  Transactions with large numbers of operations should commit correctly
