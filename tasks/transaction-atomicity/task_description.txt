task_description: |
  Fix the transaction commit operation to ensure proper atomicity.
  The current implementation doesn't handle partial failures correctly,
  and transactions may be left in an inconsistent state.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - All operations in a transaction should execute atomically
  - If any operation fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back
  - Transaction status should accurately reflect the commit result
  - Operations should execute in the order they were added
