task_description: |
  Fix the task scheduling logic to handle edge cases properly.
  The current implementation uses < instead of <= for time comparison,
  which may miss tasks scheduled for the exact current time.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Tasks scheduled for the exact current time should execute
  - Use <= for inclusive time comparison
  - Handle tasks with executeAt equal to current time
  - Past-due tasks should execute immediately
