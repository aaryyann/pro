task: scheduling-edge-cases
instructions: |
  You need  to fix the task  scheduling   logic to handle edge cases properly that is present in the TaskScheduler.start() method that is present in `src/scheduler/TaskScheduler.ts`.
  The current implementation uses <   instead of  <= for time comparison,
  which may miss tasks  scheduled for the exact current  time.




  
  The Behaviour need to be expected
  Tasks scheduled for  the  exact current time should execute
  Use  <= for inclusive time comparison
  Handle  tasks with  executeAt equal to current time
  Past tasks should execute  immediately
  Multiple  tasks scheduled for the same time  should all execute
  Tasks scheduled for future times should not execute until  their time arrives
  Task cancellation should properly  remove tasks before execution
  Tasks  should maintain  correct execution order when  scheduled at the same time
  All ready tasks should be executed ,  not just the first one
