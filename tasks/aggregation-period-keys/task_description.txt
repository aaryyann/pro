  Fix the period key generation in AnalyticsEngine.getPeriodKey().
  The current implementation doesn't pad month and date values, which can
  cause incorrect grouping when months/dates are single digits.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Period keys should be consistently formatted with zero-padding
  - Keys should be sortable chronologically
  - Same period should always generate the same key
  - Keys should handle month and date boundaries correctly
