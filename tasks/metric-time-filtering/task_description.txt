task: metric-time-filtering
instructions: |
  You need to fix the date comparison logic that is present  in  the AnalyticsEngine.getMetrics() method that is present in the `src/analytics/AnalyticsEngine.ts`.
  The current implementation uses strict inequality that are > and < , which excludes the
  metrics at the exact boundary times. It should must   use the inclusive comparison that are  >= and <=.
  
  The Behaviour that should be expected is 
  Metrics at startTime should be always included
  Metrics at endTime should be always included
  All metrics that are within the time range should always be returned
  Edge cases with exact timestamps should be always handled correctly
