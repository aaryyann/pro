task_description: |
  Fix the date comparison logic in AnalyticsEngine.getMetrics().
  The current implementation uses strict inequality (>, <) which excludes
  metrics at the exact boundary times. It should use inclusive comparison (>=, <=).
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Metrics at startTime should be included
  - Metrics at endTime should be included
  - All metrics within the time range should be returned
  - Edge cases with exact timestamps should be handled correctly
