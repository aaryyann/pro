task: metric-time-filtering
instructions: |


  You   need to fix  the date comparison logic that is present in the MetricTimeFilteringEngine.getMetrics() method that is present in the `src/analytics/MetricTimeFilteringEngine.ts`.
  The current implementation uses  strict inequalities > and <, which excludes the
  metrics at the exact boundary times. It must use the  inclusive comparisons  >= and <=.



  
  The Behaviour that should be expected is 


  Metrics at  startTime should be always included
  Metrics at endTime should be always included
  All metrics  that are within the time range should always be returned
  Edge cases with exact timestamps should be  always handled correctly
  When no time filters are provided  (startTime and endTime are undefined), the method should return all metrics matching the specified metric name
  The  method should correctly filter metrics by name first, then apply time filtering if time parameters are provided
  Filtering by metric  name must work correctly regardless of whether time filters are provided or not
