task_description: |
  Fix the asynchronous task execution bug in TaskScheduler.start() method.
  The handler() function is not being awaited, which causes tasks to execute
  without proper error handling and completion tracking.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - All scheduled tasks should execute their handlers asynchronously
  - Handlers should be properly awaited before removing tasks from the queue
  - Errors in handlers should be caught and handled appropriately
  - Tasks should only be removed after handler execution completes
  - Multiple concurrent tasks should execute correctly
